        <h2 class="headline">Otter Manifesto </h2>
<p>Here in Otter, we believe in intentional growth, in the power of beautiful places, and in living each day like one's first-- with wonder and humility.</p>

<p>Because of this, we devote our creative energy to put together relevant, life-breathing experiences to help clients nurture their most rewarding work and personal relationships.</p>

<h4>Our service include:</h4>

<ul class="service-list">
  <li>Boutique Site Scouting and booking (Corporate &amp; Personal)</li>
  <li>Customized Event Program Design (Corporate &amp; Personal)</li>
  <li>Customized Loyalty Program Design (Corporate)</li>
  <li>Customized Customer Service Design (Corporate)</li>
  <li>For our sites and event program design, we host events with a maximum headcount of 150 people. Our locations, though all very photogenic, look even better in person. Inspired by sea otters who are known to hold hands while swimming, we aim to hand-hold our clients throughout the site selection, and program design process.</li>
</ul>

<p>As an experience laboratory, we welcome guests to work with us to co-create life-breathing experiences-- you may email hazel@vendormine.ph</p>

<p>See you at the lab,</p>
